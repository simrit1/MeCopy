MeCopy (Modular Extension Copy) It is a GUI for Robocopy based on independent modules 
in which you can copy, move or delete files on your computer at the same time without any module interfering with each other.

With MeCopy you will be able to move (or delete) files in your computer  according to the extensions you picked, all in just one click. If you like to keep your computer tidy and are lazy about having to manually search for large amounts of files and move them, delete them or simply constantly transfer your game savegames or any type of backup to your portable hard drive in a fast and versatile way, MeCopy is your solution.

Features:
